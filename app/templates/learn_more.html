    <h4>ðŸ“– Story Behind the Code</h4>
    <p>Here's the story of how the UMA Chatbot leverages Dialogflow's AI capabilities to manage orders 
        for a Japanese restaurant:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Webhook Handling:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The chatbot receives incoming webhook requests from Dialogflow, processes the payload, 
                    and extracts necessary information such as intent names, entities, and parameters.</li>
                <li>It routes the requests to appropriate functions based on the intent, ensuring that user 
                    interactions are handled correctly.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>New Order:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>When a user initiates a new order by saying something like "I want to start a new order", 
                    the chatbot clears any existing session data to start fresh.</li>
                <li>It provides a list of available items, guiding the user to specify their desired food items 
                    and quantities using recognized entities.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Add Items:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Users can add items to their order by specifying the food items and quantities, e.g., 
                    "Add 2 Tuna Sushi to my order"</li>
                <li>The chatbot uses NLP to identify the food items and quantities, checks if the items 
                    exist in the database, and updates the current session accordingly.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Remove Items:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Users can remove items from their order by saying something like "Remove 1 Salmon Sushi".</li>
                <li>The chatbot identifies the items to be removed, updates the session, and provides 
                    feedback on the current order status.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Complete Orders:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Once the user indicates they don't need anything else, the chatbot prompts the user for confirmation.</li>
                <li>If the user confirms by saying "I confirm," the order is saved in the database, 
                    the total price is calculated, and the order is confirmed. The session data is then cleared.</li>
                <li>If the user cancels, the order is not completed, and the user can continue modifying the order.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Track Orders:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Users can track the status of their orders by asking, "What's the status of my order?"</li>
                <li>The chatbot retrieves the order status from the database and informs the user, 
                    leveraging Dialogflow's ability to manage context and session parameters.</li>
                <li>If you want to test the chatbot on this intent, you can use the order id 40 or 41.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Database Helper Functions:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The project includes helper functions for database interactions, such as checking 
                    if an item exists, saving orders, and calculating total prices.</li>
                <li>These functions ensure efficient data handling and provide a seamless experience for users.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Session Management:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The application maintains active sessions and their last activity times 
                    to track and manage user interactions.</li>
                <li>Periodic cleanup tasks run to remove inactive sessions, 
                    ensuring resource efficiency and up-to-date session data.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ul>
