## Step 4:
- Add the HTTPS URL in the Fulfillment settings of Dialogflow:
    - Navigate to the agent's Fulfillment settings.
    - Enable the Webhook and add the HTTPS URL:
        - If you are using ngrok to generate the HTTPS URL:
            - This URL is the forwarding address provided by ngrok when you run the `ngrok http 8000` command. It securely exposes your local FastAPI server to the internet.
            - Refer to the `ngrok_setup.md` file for detailed instructions.
            - Example: https://your-custom-domain.ngrok-free.app
        - If you are not using ngrok (e.g., in production):
            - Use the HTTPS URL of your deployed FastAPI server.
            - Ensure the server is accessible over the internet and has a valid SSL certificate.
- Click "Save" to update the fulfillment settings.
